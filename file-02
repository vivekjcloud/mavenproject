Introduction: E-business infrastructure refers to the combination of hardware such as servers and client PCs in an organization, the network used to link this hardware and the software applications used to deliver services to workers within the e-business and also to its partners and customers.
Infrastructure also includes the architecture of the networks, hardware and software and where it is located. Finally, infrastructure can also be considered to include the methods for publishing data and documents accessed through e-business applications. A key decision with managing this infrastructure is which elements are located within the company and which are managed externally as third-party managed applications, data servers and networks. It is also important that the e-business infrastructure and the process of reviewing new technology investments be flexible enough to support changes required by the business to compete effectively. 
For example, for the media there are many new technologies being developed which were described from 2005 onwards as Web 2.0 and IPTV (television delivered over the broadband Internet).We will look at these approaches later in this chapter, but for now look at the implications in the Real-world e-business experiences interview and consider the implications for the newspaper publishing industry. In a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors in April 20021, Rupert Murdoch of News Corporation said:
E-business infrastructure components 
The different components of e-business architecture which need to be managed relate to each other. The different components can be conceived of as different layers with defined interfaces between each layer. The different layers can best be understood in relation to a typical task performed by a user of an e-business system.
